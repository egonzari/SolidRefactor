# SolidRefactor Workshop

It's a project to work out the SOLID principles refactoring a sample project.

- We are here to understand and apply the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles.

- We are going to work in pairs to exercise pair programming methodoligy.

- We are going to discuss **Good Practices** or **DOs and DON'Ts**.

- We are going to improve our software development quality.

## Getting started

In this workshop we are going to use our refactoring skills to apply our standard [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) pattern and discuss about it. First of all we are going to review the SOLID principles if is needed, then explain and understand our MVP pattern implementation. Also we are going to discuss how we can improve our code stability and quality.

This repository contains an Android application completly coupled, non extendible, non testeable and poorly implemented. We have to:
- Find everything doesn't complain the SOLID principles and tipical development mistakes.
- Refactor the project appling MVP pattern. Our View **MUST BE PASSIVE** and our Presenter **MUST BE DUMB** as possible. [Info](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html) and [+ Info](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html) and [Extra Info](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html)
  - It's **mandatory** pass the **TESTS**. We have implement our presenters to satisfy the tests written.
- Improve the code stability.  

### Extra
For our developers that have been working with our MVP pattern and/or with our architecute I have two extra things to implement:
- Handle Memento following the SOLID principles. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
- Think how to navigate through User Story Step and implement following the SOLID principles,  **Navigator not allowed**


## Recommendations before starting

- :star: **STAR THE REPOSITORY!!!**  :stuck_out_tongue:
- Fork this repository.
- Make couples with different levels, Senior with Junior or Midd with Junior. If you are two Midds or to Juniors please don't stop asking ;)
